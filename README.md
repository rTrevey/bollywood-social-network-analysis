bollywood-social-network-analysis
=================================

Analyzing Bollywood's social network data based on Wikipedia data using Python.
For this project we will be using 

1. [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/)
2. [PyDot](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (We will be using v3.2.1)

Network generated out of NetworkX is visualized using [Graphviz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydot/1.0.28)

Initially I had though of creating a parser, but was overkill. Just copy pasted stuff into Spread Sheet in CSV format
